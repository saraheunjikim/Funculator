## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  Well, I wanted to do something for fun and to entertain my friend's niece while I was taking a weekend break at her house. So I came up with the fun-culator. 
  </p>
  <p>
I created the interface first using Tkinter and then started adding different functions for each button.
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
Learning Tkinter is always challenging to me, as there are different layout systems such as pack, grid, and place. It was tricky using one layout system, and then if I get stuck, I might find a solution using a different layout system. So that was challenging, and I didn't want to spend too much time on the interface, so I made it simple as possible.
</p>
  <p>
Also, because the logic used for the fun-culator is not logical, I had a few problems having different outputs for different combinations. Nonetheless, my niece loved it playing it, so that was something I achieved!
